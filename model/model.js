        <p>
          There's a fire starting in my heart Reaching a fever pitch and
          it's bringing me out the dark Finally, I can see you crystal
          clear Go ahead and sell me out and I'll lay your ship bare See
          how I'll leave with every piece of you Don't underestimate the
          things that I will do There's a fire starting in my heart
          Reaching a fever pitch and it's bring me out the dark The
          scars of your love remind me of us They keep me thinking that
          we almost had it all The scars of your love, they leave me
          breathless I can't help feeling We could have had it all
          (You're gonna wish you never had met me) Rolling in the deep
          (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep) You had my heart
          inside of your hands (You're gonna wish you never had met me)
          And you played it to the beat (Tears are gonna fall, rolling
          in the deep)

          Baby, I have no story to be told But I've heard one on you and
          I'm gonna make your head burn Think of me in the depths of
          your despair Make a home down there as mine sure won't be
          shared The scars of your love remind me of us (Tears are gonna
          fall, rolling in the deep) They keep me thinking that we
          almost had it all (You're gonna wish you never had met me) The
          scars of your love, they leave me breathless (Tears are gonna
          fall, rolling in the deep) I can't help feeling We could have
          had it all (You're gonna wish you never had met me) Rolling in
          the deep (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep) You had
          my heart inside of your hands (You're gonna wish you never had
          met me) And you played it to the beat (Tears are gonna fall,
          rolling in the deep) Could have had it all Rolling in the deep
          You had my heart inside of your hands But you played it with a
          beating

          Throw your soul through every open door Count your blessings

          remember Sure, she's got it all But, baby, is that really what
          you want Bless your soul, you got your head in the clouds She
          made a fool out of you And, boy, she's bringing you down She
          made your heart melt But you're cold to the core Now rumor has
          it she ain't got your love anymore Rumor has it (rumor) Rumor

          She is half your age But I'm guessing that's the reason that
          you stayed I heard you've been missing me You've been telling
          people things you shouldn't be Like when we creep out and she
          ain't around Haven't you heard the rumors Bless your soul, you
          got your head in the clouds You made a fool out of me And,
          boy, you're bringing me down You made my heart melt, yet I'm
          cold to the core But rumor has it I'm the one you're leaving
          her for Rumor has it (rumor) Rumor has it (rumor) Rumor has it

          I let it fall, my hart And as it fell, you rose to claim it It
          was dark, and I was over Until you kissed my lips and you
          saved me My hands, they were strong But my knees were far too
          weak To stand in your arms Without falling to your feet But
          there's a side to you That I never knew, never knew All the
          things you'd say They were never true, never true And the
          games you'd play You would always win, always win But I set
          fire to the rain Watched it pour as I touched your face Well,
          it burned while I cried 'Cause I heard it screaming out your
          name, your name! When I lay with you I could stay there Close
          my eyes Feel you here forever You and me together Nothing is

          I heard that you're settled down That you found a girl and
          you're married now I heard that your dreams came true Guess
          she gave you things, I didn't give to you Old friend, why are
          you so shy? Ain't like you to hold back or hide from the light
          I hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited But I couldn't
          stay away, I couldn't fight it I had hoped you'd see my face
          And that you'd be reminded that for me, it isn't over Never
          mind, I'll find someone like you I wish nothing but the best
