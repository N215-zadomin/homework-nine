                <p>
                  I heard that you're settled down That you found a girl and
                  you're married now I heard that your dreams came true Guess
                  she gave you things, I didn't give to you Old friend, why are
                  you so shy? Ain't like you to hold back or hide from the light
                  I hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited But I couldn't
                  stay away, I couldn't fight it I had hoped you'd see my face
                  And that you'd be reminded that for me, it isn't over Never
                  mind, I'll find someone like you I wish nothing but the best
                  for you, too "Don't forget me, " I beg I remember you said
                </p>

                  "Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead"
                  "Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead"
                  You know how the time flies Only yesterday was the time of our
                  lives We were born and raised in a summer haze Bound by the
                  surprise of our glory days I hate to turn up out of the blue,
                  uninvited But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it I had
                  hoped you'd see my face And that you'd be reminded that for
                  me, it isn't over Never mind, I'll find someone like you I
                  wish nothing but the best for you, too "Don't forget me, " I
                  begged I remember you said "Sometimes it lasts in love, but
                  sometimes it hurts instead" Nothing compares, no worries or
                  cares Regrets and mistakes, they're memories made
