This week, our assignment was pretty much the same as homeowork eight's. We were to add content to the page when you click on a link by using the MVC model and jQuery. We were to again only use one page and load all the content onto that specific page. It needed to be fully developed and look like an actual website. I feel like the only struggle I really had this week was understanding the different uses of app.js and model.js. Other than thatm this assignment was not that bad to complete.
